- WebSocket client - Real-time updates

## Key Features

### üöÄ Real-Time Processing
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Live page-by-page processing for multi-page documents
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with page counters
- **Instant Results**: See extracted text as each page completes

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure Local Deployment
- **Offline Operation**: Models run entirely on local servers without internet dependency
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive documents never leave the organization's infrastructure
- **Zero Cloud Dependency**: Complete processing pipeline operates offline for maximum security
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed for deployment on GEOPIC's secure local servers

### üéØ Advanced OCR Capabilities
- **Vision-Language Models**: Custom-trained models for superior accuracy
- **Layout Awareness**: Preserves document structure and formatting
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP

### üí° User Experience
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive file upload
- **Side-by-side Layout**: Image preview alongside extracted text
- **Bulk Operations**: Copy all, download all functionality
- **AI Assistant**: Document Q&A capabilities

### üîß Technical Excellence
- **Scalable Architecture**: FastAPI backend with React frontend
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error recovery
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient processing with 300 DPI quality

## System Architecture



The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Frontend (React)**: User interface with real-time updates
2. **Backend (FastAPI)**: API server with WebSocket support
3. **ML Engine**: Custom VLM models for text extraction

## Project Impact & Results

- **Security**: 100% offline operation ensuring sensitive data never leaves local infrastructure
- **Accuracy**: Achieved ‚â•95% accuracy with significant improvement over traditional OCR methods
- **Speed**: Real-time processing with efficient page-by-page streaming
- **User Experience**: Seamless drag-and-drop interface with Embedded AI assistant for real-time queries based on extracted text.
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise deployment at ONGC
